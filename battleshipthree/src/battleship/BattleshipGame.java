/* This is the main class. In this class you will set up the game; accept shots from the user;
 * display the results; print final scores; and ask the user if s/he wants to play again.
 * All input/output is done here (although some of it is done by calling a print() method in 
 * the Ocean class). All computation will be done in the Ocean class and the various Ship
 * classes.
 * To aid the user, row numbers should be displayed along the left edge of the array, and
 * column numbers should be displayed along hte top. Numbers should be 0 to 9, *not* 1 to
 * 10. The top left corner square should be location 0,0. Use different characters to indicate
 * locations that contain a hit, a miss and have never been fired upon (see Ocean class)
 * 
 * USE METHODS. DOn't cram everything into one or two methods, but try to divide up the work
 * into sensible parts with reasonable names.
